                            We came very close [to a] disaster point. We are just about to jump from the cliff and finish it off. Luckily, Coronavirus stopped us from that jump.So, if the virus ends somehow, are we going back to that level, to finish the jump? Is this the solution that we are proposing? Going back to that world is equal to committing suicide. Are we going to commit suicide? That's the question we have to ask, and answer. And my answer is very clear: No. No. No. We are not going to go back and finish our suicide.
